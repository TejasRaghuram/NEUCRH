# UDonate

## Description
UDonate is a platform designed to support marginalized communities facing the increasing impacts of climate change. Our goal is to simplify donations and provide essential resources tailored to the unique needs of these communities. 

Through features like an equitable donation algorithm and transparent fund distribution, users can make direct contributions to disaster preparedness and relief efforts. UDonate emphasizes accountability and community resilience, ensuring that support reaches those who need it most.
